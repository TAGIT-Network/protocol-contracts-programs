# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please email security@tag-it.network with a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and potential impact. Encrypt sensitive reports using our PGP key published on the TAG IT security portal. We will acknowledge receipt within 1 business day.

## Disclosure Process

1. Triage and validate the report.
2. Assign severity, notify relevant stakeholders, and create a remediation plan.
3. Develop and test fixes in a protected branch with security sign-off.
4. Deploy remediations following the dev → stage → prod promotion workflow and monitor for regressions.
5. Coordinate public disclosure with the reporter once mitigations are in place.

## Bounty Program

Qualified vulnerabilities may be eligible for rewards under the TAG IT bounty program. See https://tag-it.network/bounty for scopes and reward tiers.
